# Setting up Effects

We set the themes in [Setting the Themes,](./sthemes.md) so now it's time for (hopefully) the final section, Setting up Effects. You are almost finished with the rice.

1. Go to Desktop Behavior > Desktop Effects in Settings.
2. Change these effects:
  - Set blur strength ticks ahead of Noise strength.
  - Turn off Fade.
  - Turn on Glide.
  - Turn on Sliding popups
  - Turn **off** Minimize Aniimation and turn **on** Magic Lamp.
  - Turn on Dialog Parent and Dim Screen for Administrator Mode (not accurate but looks good).
3. Close System Settings and open Konsole.
4. Click Settings, go to Edit Current Profile > Appearance, and then edit Linux Colors:
  - Turn on Blur background.
  - Set Background transparency to 30%.
5. That's it!
